During the semester, I was responsible for the online portion of two discussion sections. I also held weekly office hours, wrote answer keys, and graded.

The summer before, I participated in the course revamp by developing labs including First-Year Writing Seminars, Seat Packing, and Diet Problem (ranked 1st, 2nd, and 5th respectively in a survey where students were asked to pick their top 3 labs).
