excerpt: 'Within a much larger project, I focused on expanding the testbed with real-world problems, including a model to minimize COVID-19 infections in a campus setting, to enhance solver testing. I also coded and modified algorithms from literature such as Nelder-Mead of which their solving power on the testbed can then be compared.'

### Overview
Stochastic simulation is a technique in the field of operations research that has been widely applied in many industries. Simulation optimization arises when optimizing some functions that can only be evaluated through a stochastic simulation. A large number of simulation optimization solvers exist, but little effort has been made to compare them. We have expanded upon a [repository](https://github.com/simopt-admin/simopt) of simulation optimization problems that model real-world scenarios. These problems allow comparisons among solvers, which aim to find optimal solutions more efficiently.
