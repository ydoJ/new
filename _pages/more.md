## ORIE Showcase
Lended a hand as co-president of the ORIE Undergrad Society in bringing to realization the first ORIE Showcase. Read about it [here](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/news/successful-orie-showcase-highlights-undergrad-research-promotes-field).

## ENGRI 1101 Guest Lecture
Willem and I were invited to give a guest lecture to the introductory ORIE class on how the concepts they learned, specifically ILPs, were used in our research.
<!-- What's crazy is that this class was the very first class I took at Cornell, and a few weeks before my graduation, I was in the same room as back then except this time facing the next group of bright-eyed students. -->

We also did a TEDx-styled presentation and poster session on our little "press tour".

## Seat Packing for the Win
Thank you Cornell ORIE for sharing this [article](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/news/orie-team-led-jody-zhu-takes-first-place-iise-undergraduate-research-competition). Seat packing stemmed from the course scheduling team needing to know new room capacities under social distancing.
